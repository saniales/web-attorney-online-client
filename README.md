# Contributing

All contributions are welcome, but remember the basic rules:

1. **One PR solves one issue** (we will not merge any PR that has no issue associated)
2. We adhere to a severe coding style, so **try to have your contribution aligned** with the rest of your code. 

   Explicit code guidelines will come out as soon as we progress, for now just try to keep your code as clean as possible.

   We are happy to help in reorganizing your work ;)
3. **You do not have to be a developer to contribute** we are also accepting the help of graphic designers and translators to help us with internationalization of the project.
